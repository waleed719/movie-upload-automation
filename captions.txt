#BMW began as an aircraft engine manufacturer in 1916, only shifting to cars and motorcycles after the Treaty of Versailles restricted German aviation production. Its iconic blue and white logo isn't a spinning propeller, as commonly thought, but rather represents the colors of the Bavarian flag, its home region. The distinctive BMW headquarters in Munich, built in 1972, is actually designed to resemble a four-cylinder engine. In the late 1950s, BMW was on the verge of bankruptcy and nearly acquired by Mercedes-Benz, only being saved by a timely investment from the Quandt family. Decades before the current EV trend, BMW introduced its first all-electric car, the 1602e, at the 1972 Munich Olympics. BMW's brand portfolio extends beyond its own nameplate, as it acquired both Rolls-Royce and retained the Mini brand after the sale of the Rover Group. The characteristic "kidney grille" that defines BMW's front fascia first appeared on the BMW 303 model in 1933. In 1937, BMW produced a supercharged motorcycle that achieved a world record speed of 173.7 miles per hour. The highly regarded BMW M performance division launched its first road-legal car, the mid-engined M1 supercar, in 1978. Uniquely, BMW still maintains the capability to produce parts for some of its very old vehicles, including those from the World War II era, enabling authentic restorations.

#Ferrari was initially a racing team, Scuderia Ferrari, founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1929, with the production of road cars beginning only in 1947 to fund the racing activities. The famous Prancing Horse logo was originally the emblem of a World War I Italian fighter pilot, Francesco Baracca, whose mother asked Enzo to use it for good luck. The iconic "Ferrari Red" wasn't a choice for aesthetics but a mandatory color assigned to all Italian Grand Prix racing cars by the International Automobile Federation. The first car entirely designed and built by Enzo Ferrari wasn't actually called a Ferrari; due to a non-compete clause with Alfa Romeo, it was the Auto Avio Costruzioni 815. Ferrari owns its own private test track, the Fiorano Circuit, located right next to its factory in Maranello, allowing for immediate testing and development. Enzo Ferrari famously had a difficult relationship with Henry Ford II, which led to Ford's creation of the GT40 to beat Ferrari at Le Mans after a failed acquisition attempt. While known for its V12 engines, Ferrari also developed V6 and V8 engines, notably with the Dino line, which was meant to be a more accessible sports car. The company generally maintains limited production numbers to preserve exclusivity and demand for its vehicles. Ferrari has expanded its brand far beyond cars, with a significant portion of its revenue coming from merchandising, licensing deals, and even the Ferrari World theme park in Abu Dhabi, which features the world's fastest roller coaster. The final car to receive Enzo Ferrari's personal approval before his death was the legendary F40.

#Toyota actually started as a textiles business, with its founder Sakichi Toyoda developing an automatic loom. The company was originally named "Toyoda" but changed to "Toyota" because it took eight strokes to write in Katakana, and eight is a lucky number in East Asian cultures. A city in Japan, formerly named Koromo, changed its name to "Toyota City" in honor of the company. Approximately 80% of Toyota vehicles sold 20 years ago are still active on the roads today, showcasing their renowned durability. Toyota was the first motor company to produce over 10 million cars in one year, achieving this feat in 2013. The company invests over $1 million every hour in research and development. The Toyota Prius was a groundbreaking success, becoming the world's top-selling hybrid nameplate. Toyota is still largely a family business, with current CEO Akio Toyoda being a direct descendant of the founder. The company took inspiration from American cars like Dodge and Chevrolet in its early days. Toyota is a global leader in hybrid technology and has consistently been a top-selling brand in many markets worldwide.

#Volkswagen, which means "People's Car" in German, was founded by the German government in 1937 with the aim of producing an affordable car for the masses. The iconic Beetle, or Type 1, is Volkswagen's most recognized model and became a global cultural icon, selling over 21 million units. Volkswagen is one of the largest car manufacturers in the world, often vying for the top spot in global sales. Many of Volkswagen's car names, like Golf, Jetta, Passat, and Scirocco, are named after ocean currents or winds. Volkswagen owns a wide array of other automotive brands, including Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini, Bentley, Bugatti, and Skoda. The company has a strong racing heritage, particularly with models like the Polo R WRC and Golf GTI TCR. Volkswagen was an early adopter of seatbelts as standard equipment in its vehicles. The company's main factory in Wolfsburg, Germany, is one of the largest single-plant car manufacturing facilities globally. Volkswagen has been heavily investing in electric vehicle technology, aiming for a significant presence in the EV market. The company once held the Guinness World Record for the heaviest object pulled by a production vehicle.

#Ford Motor Company is the second largest family-owned company in the world. Henry Ford's great-grandson, William Clay Ford, Jr. (Bill Ford), currently serves as the company's executive chairman. Henry Ford and inventor Thomas Edison were lifelong friends. The iconic blue oval Ford logo was not introduced until four years after the company began production. In 1914, Henry Ford introduced the revolutionary "$5-a-day" wage, which significantly boosted workers' living standards and reduced employee turnover. The Ford F-Series has been America's best-selling truck for decades and often the best-selling vehicle overall. A Ford Mustang was famously reassembled on the observation deck of the Empire State Building in 1965. Ford played a crucial role in wartime production, shifting its focus to manufacturing military equipment during World War II. Henry Ford was an advocate for sustainable materials and experimented with a biodegradable car made from soybeans in the 1940s. The first Ford car ever sold, a Model A, was purchased by Dr. Pfennig in 1903 for $850.

#Honda was founded by Soichiro Honda, a man with no formal education, who began by attaching surplus army engines to bicycles. Honda is the world's largest motorcycle manufacturer and has been since 1959. The company developed ASIMO, one of the most advanced humanoid robots, demonstrating its expertise beyond automotive. Honda was the first Japanese automaker to release a dedicated luxury brand, Acura, in the North American market in 1986. The company is known for its VTEC (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control) engine technology, which optimizes valve operation for both power and fuel efficiency. Honda was the first Japanese car company to establish a full manufacturing plant in the United States, opening its Marysville, Ohio, facility in 1982. The Honda Civic is one of the longest-running and most successful car models globally, with production spanning over 50 years. Honda has a strong presence in various motorsports, including Formula 1, MotoGP, and IndyCar. Despite being a global giant, Honda's philosophy, "The Power of Dreams," emphasizes innovation and challenging conventional thinking. Honda developed the CVCC (Compound Vortex Controlled Combustion) engine in the 1970s, which met strict emission regulations without needing a catalytic converter.

#Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz's Patent-Motorwagen from 1886, widely considered the first automobile. The three-pointed star logo symbolizes Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft's ambition to dominate land, sea, and air. Mercedes-Benz pioneered many automotive safety features, including crumple zones (patented in 1952) and anti-lock braking systems (ABS), which debuted in the S-Class in 1978. The iconic "Silver Arrows" nickname for Mercedes-Benz race cars originated when a W 25 car's white paint was scraped off to meet weight regulations in 1934, revealing the silver aluminum body underneath. Mercedes-Benz developed a hybrid vehicle as early as 1906, the Mixte model. The performance division, AMG, started as an independent engineering firm founded by former Mercedes-Benz engineers before being fully integrated into the company. Mercedes-Benz produced the world's first production car with four-wheel brakes in 1924. The brand is known for its luxurious S-Class, which has historically introduced many advanced technologies before they become widespread. Mercedes-Benz engines have powered various vehicles, including early automobiles, racing cars, trucks, buses, and even boats and aircraft. The most expensive car ever sold at auction was a 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupe, fetching over $142 million.

The four rings of the #Audi logo represent the merger of four independent motor vehicle manufacturers: Audi, Horch, DKW, and Wanderer, which formed Auto Union in 1932. The name "Audi" is the Latin translation of "Horch," the last name of the founder, August Horch, meaning "listen" or "hear." Audi was one of the first car manufacturers to perform crash tests on its vehicles, dating back to 1938, demonstrating its early commitment to safety. Audi revolutionized rally racing with its Quattro all-wheel-drive system in the 1980s, dominating the World Rally Championship. Audi was the first German carmaker to introduce a left-hand drive vehicle, the Audi Type K, in 1921. Audi was also the first manufacturer to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race with both a diesel-powered car (in 2006) and a hybrid-powered car (in 2012). The company pioneered the use of a dual-clutch gearbox in a rally car, significantly improving gear shifts. Audi maintains a strong focus on advanced lighting technology, including LED and laser headlights. Many Audi models feature their distinctive virtual cockpit, a fully digital instrument cluster. Audi's first luxury sedan for the US market, the Audi 5000, faced significant controversy in the 1980s due to unintended acceleration claims, which were later largely attributed to driver error.

#Chevrolet was co-founded in 1911 by Swiss race car driver Louis Chevrolet and William C. Durant, who also founded General Motors. The origin of the iconic Chevrolet "bowtie" emblem is widely debated; some theories suggest it was inspired by wallpaper in a Parisian hotel, a newspaper advertisement, or even a doodle by Durant himself. The Chevrolet Suburban, first introduced in 1935, holds the title for the longest-running automotive nameplate in history. Chevrolet produced military equipment during World War II, halting civilian car production to support the war effort. The Chevrolet Corvette, first introduced in 1953, is one of America's most iconic sports cars and has a strong racing pedigree, winning the "24 Hours of Le Mans" multiple times. Chevrolet was among the first companies to offer built-in 4G LTE Wi-Fi in its vehicles. GM, Chevrolet's parent company, has produced over 500 million vehicles in its history. Chevrolet is a global brand, with vehicles sold in over 80 countries worldwide. The Chevrolet Volt, released in 2011, was one of the first mass-produced extended-range electric vehicles. Chevrolet has won the most NASCAR Cup Series races out of any manufacturer.

#Nissan cars were initially sold under the "Datsun" brand name until 1986. Nissan Motor Company traces its roots back to 1911, making it over 100 years old. A Nissan-designed engine powered Japan's first satellite launch, the Ohsumi, in 1970. Nissan formed a long-standing alliance with French automaker Renault in 1999, which later expanded to include Mitsubishi. The Nissan GT-R sports car earned the nickname "Godzilla" due to its powerful performance and dominance on the racetrack. Nissan has changed its company logo multiple times throughout its history, with the most recent redesign occurring in 2020. The Nissan Leaf, introduced in 2010, was one of the world's first mass-produced all-electric vehicles and has sold over half a million units globally. Nissan holds several Guinness World Records, including for the largest synchronized car dance and the largest parade of Nissan cars. Nissan's corporate philosophy emphasizes "driving innovation" and a "purpose-driven approach." The company has a significant manufacturing presence in Mexico, with plants producing vehicles for various global markets.

#The word "Hyundai" means "modern" or "contemporary" in Korean, and it's pronounced closer to "Hun-day." Hyundai Motor Company was established in 1967, and by 2011, it had become the world's fourth-largest motor manufacturer. Hyundai owns the South Korean automaker Kia, which it acquired in 1997, and also established its luxury car brand, Genesis, in 2015. Hyundai developed its first proprietary gasoline engine, the Alpha, and its own transmission in 1991, signaling its technological independence. The company operates the second-largest automobile manufacturing facility in the world in Ulsan, South Korea, with an annual production capacity of 1.6 million units. Hyundai was an early adopter of hybrid technology, developing its first hybrid electric vehicle in 1991. The company has seven research and development centers around the world, including locations in Germany, Japan, and India. Hyundai is the second-largest company in South Korea, after Samsung. Hyundai has been actively investing in hydrogen fuel cell technology, with models like the Nexo. The Hyundai Pony, introduced in 1975, was the first mass-produced South Korean car.

#While commonly associated with #Elon Musk, #Tesla was actually founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning; Elon Musk later joined as a major investor and chairman. The company is named after Nikola Tesla, the brilliant Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, and futurist known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system. The first Tesla car was the Roadster, launched in 2008, which was the first production electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells. Tesla's Gigafactory Nevada is one of the world's largest buildings by footprint, producing batteries and electric vehicle components. Tesla vehicles feature an advanced driver-assistance system called Autopilot, with ongoing development towards full self-driving capabilities. Some Tesla models, like the Model X, feature distinctive "falcon-wing doors" that open upwards. The Tesla Model 3 is marketed as the company's most affordable vehicle, designed for a broader market. Tesla unveiled its futuristic Cybertruck pickup in 2019, known for its angular design and durable stainless-steel exoskeleton. Tesla's overarching mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy, encompassing not just electric vehicles but also energy storage and solar products. A Tesla Roadster was famously launched into space aboard a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket in 2018 as a test payload.
